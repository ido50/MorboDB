=head1 NAME

MorboDB::Database - A MorboDB database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use MorboDB;

	my $morbodb = MorboDB->new;

	my $db = $morbodb->get_database('my_database');
	my $coll = $db->get_collection('articles');
	# use $coll as described in MorboDB::Collection

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the API for handling databases in a L<MorboDB> container.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

The name of the database. String, required.

=cut

has 'name' => (is => 'ro', required => 1);

has '_top' => (is => 'ro', required => 1, weak_ref => 1);

has '_colls' => (is => 'ro', default => sub { {} });

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 collection_names()

Returns a list with the names of all collections in the database.

=cut

sub collection_names { sort keys %{$_[0]->_colls} }

=head2 get_collection( $name )

Returns a L<MorboDB::Collection> object with the given name:

	my $db = $morbodb->get_database('users');
	my $coll = $db->get_collection('users');

Like MongoDB, you can create a child-collection (purely semantics really)
by using dots, so 'users.admins' can be thought of as a child collection
of users:

	my $admins = $db->get_collection('users.admins');
	# or
	my $admins = $db->get_collection('users')->get_collection('admins');

=cut

sub get_collection {
	my ($self, $name) = @_;

	confess "You must provide the name of the collection to get."
		unless $name;

	return $self->_colls->{$name} ||= MorboDB::Collection->new(name => $name, _database => $self);
}

=head2 get_gridfs()

Not implemented. Doesn't do anything here except returning false.

=cut

sub get_gridfs { return } # not implemented

=head2 drop()

Drops the database, removes any collections it had and data they had.

=cut

sub drop {
	my $self = shift;

	foreach (keys %{$self->_colls}) {
		$_->drop;
	}

	delete $self->_top->_dbs->{$self->name};
	return;
}

=head2 last_error()

Not implemented. Doesn't do anything here except returning false.

=cut

sub last_error { return } # not implemented

=head2 run_command()

Not implemented. Doesn't do anything here except returning false.

=cut

sub run_command { return } # not implemented

=head2 eval()

Not implemented. Doesn't do anything here except returning false.

=cut

sub eval { return } # not implemented

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< You must provide the name of the collection to get. >>

This error is returned by the C<get_collection()> method when you do not
provide it with the name of the database you want to get/create.

=back
