=head1 NAME

MorboDB::Cursor - A cursor/iterator for MorboDB query results

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $cursor = $coll->find({ year => { '$gte' => 2000 } })->sort({ year => -1 });
	while (my $object = $cursor->next) {
		...
	}

	my @objects = $cursor->all;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an iterator/cursor for query operations performed
on a L<MorboDB::Collection> using the C<find()>/C<query()> methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 started_iterating

A boolean value indicating whether the cursor has started looking for
documents in the database. Initially false. When true, setting modifiers
such as C<sort>, C<fields>, C<skip> and C<limit> is not possible without
first calling C<reset()>.

=head2 immortal

Boolean value, means nothing in MorboDB.

=head2 tailable

Boolean value, not implemented in MorboDB.

=head2 partial

Boolean value, not implemented in MorboDB.

=head2 slave_okay

Boolean value, not implemented in MorboDB.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 fields( \%fields )

Selects which fields are returned. The default is all fields. C<_id> is always returned.
Returns this cursor for chaining operations.

=cut

sub fields {
	my ($self, $f) = @_;

	confess 'cannot set fields after querying'
		if $self->started_iterating;

	confess 'not a hash reference'
		unless ref $f && ref $f eq 'HASH';

	$self->_set_fields($f);

	return $self;
}

=head2 limit( $num )

Returns a maximum of C<$num> results. Returns this cursor for chaining operations.

=cut

sub limit {
	my ($self, $num) = @_;

	confess 'cannot set limit after querying'
		if $self->started_iterating;

	$self->_set_limit($num);

	return $self;
}

=head2 skip( $num )

Skips the first C<$num> results. Returns this cursor for chaining operations.

=cut

sub skip {
	my ($self, $num) = @_;

	confess 'cannot set skip after querying'
		if $self->started_iterating;

	$self->_set_skip($num);

	return $self;
}

=head2 sort( $order )

Adds a sort to the cursor. Argument is either a hash reference or a
L<Tie::IxHash> object. Returns this cursor for chaining operations.

=cut

sub sort {
	my ($self, $order) = @_;

	confess 'cannot set sort after querying'
		if $self->started_iterating;

	if ($order && ref $order eq 'Tie::IxHash') {
		$self->_set_sort($order);
	} elsif ($order && ref $order eq 'HASH') {
		my $obj = Tie::IxHash->new;
		foreach (keys %$order) {
			$obj->Push($_ => $order->{$_});
		}
		$self->_set_sort($obj);
	} else {
		confess 'sort() needs a Tie::IxHash object or a hash reference.';
	}

	return $self;
}

=head2 snapshot()

Not implemented. Simply returns true here.

=cut

sub snapshot {
	# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET (IF EVEN SHOULD BE)
	1;
}

=head2 explain()

Not implemented. Simply returns true here.

=cut

sub explain {
	# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
	1;
}

=head2 reset()

Resets the cursor. After being reset, pre-query methods can be called
on the cursor (C<sort>, C<limit>, etc.) and subsequent calls to C<next()>,
C<has_next()>, or C<all()> will re-query the database.

=cut

sub reset {
	my $self = shift;

	$self->_set_started_iterating(0);
	$self->_clear_fields;
	$self->_clear_limit;
	$self->_clear_skip;
	$self->_clear_sort;
	$self->_clear_docs;
	$self->_set_index(0);

	return 1;
}

=head2 info()

Not implemented. Returns an empty hash-ref here.

=cut

sub info {
	# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
	{};
}

=head2 count()

Returns the number of documents the query matched.

=cut

sub count {
	my $self = shift;

	unless ($self->started_iterating) {
		# haven't started iterating yet, let's query the database
		$self->_query_db;
	}

	return scalar @{$self->_docs};
}

=head2 has_next()

Checks if there is another result to fetch.

=cut

sub has_next {
	my $self = shift;

	unless ($self->started_iterating) {
		# haven't started iterating yet, let's query the database
		$self->_query_db;
	}

	return $self->_index < $self->count;
}

=head2 next()

Returns the next object in the cursor. Returns C<undef> if no more data is available.

=cut

sub next {
	my $self = shift;

	# return nothing if we've started iterating but have no more results
	return if $self->started_iterating && !$self->has_next;

	unless ($self->started_iterating) {
		# haven't started iterating yet, let's query the database
		$self->_query_db;
		return unless $self->count;
	}

	my $doc = clone($self->_coll->_data->{$self->_docs->[$self->_index]});
	$self->_inc_index;

	if ($self->_fields) {
		my $ret = {};
		foreach (keys %{$self->_fields}) {
			$ret->{$_} = $doc->{$_}
				if exists $self->_fields->{$_} || $_ eq '_id';
		}
		return $ret;
	} else {
		return $doc;
	}
}

=head2 all()

Returns an array of all objects in the result.

=cut

sub all {
	my $self = shift;

	my @docs;
	while ($self->has_next) {
		push(@docs, $self->next);
	}

	return @docs;

			# here if we're not sorting, otherwise we
			# need to do that later, after we've sorted
			if (!$self->_has_sort && $self->_skip && $skipped < $self->_skip) {

		}

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This module throws the following exceptions:

=over

=item C<< cannot set fields/skip/limit/sort after querying >>

This error will be thrown when you're trying to modify the cursor after
it has already started querying the database. You can tell if the cursor
already started querying the database by taking a look at the C<started_iterating>
attribute. If you want to modify the cursor after iteration has started,
you can used the C<reset()> method, but the query will have to run again.

=item C<< not a hash reference >>

This error is thrown by the C<fields()> method when you're not providing it
with a hash-reference of fields like so:

	$cursor->fields({ name => 1, datetime => 1 });

=item C<< sort() needs a Tie::IxHash object or a hash reference. >>

This error is thrown by the C<sort()> method when you're not giving it
a hash reference or L<Tie::IxHash> object to sort according to, like so:

	$cursor->sort(Tie::IxHash->new(name => 1, datetime => -1));
