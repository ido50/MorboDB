=head1 NAME

MorboDB::OID - An object ID in MorboDB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

When inserting documents into a collection, if you don't provide an '_id'
attribute, this module will create one automatically.

	my $id = $collection->insert({ name => 'Alice', age => 20 });

C<$id> will be a C<MorboDB::OID> object that can be used to retreive or
update the saved document:

	$collection->update({ _id => $id }, { age => { '$inc' => 1 } });
	# now Alice is 21

To create a copy of an existing OID, you must set the value attribute in
the constructor. For example:

	my $id1 = MongoDB::OID->new;
	my $id2 = MongoDB::OID->new(value => $id1->value);

Now C<$id1> and C<$id2> will have the same value.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A MorboDB::OID object uniquely represents a document in a L<MorboDB::Collection>.
When you don't provide a documents with the '_id' attribute during insertion,
this module will create an ID automatically.

OIDs in MorboDB are created using L<Data::UUID>, so they are 36-characters
long and do not resemble OIDs in MongoDB.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 value

A 36-characters long string representation of the OID in conventional UUID format.
See L<UUID on Wikipedia|https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Universally_unique_identifier&oldid=443132869>
for more information on UUID format.

=cut

has 'value' => (is => 'ro', builder => '_build_value');

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 to_string()

This really just returns the 'value' attribute.

=cut

sub to_string { shift->value }

=head2 get_time()

Not implemented. Only returns C<undef> here.

=cut

sub get_time { undef }

=head2 TO_JSON()

Meant to be called by the L<JSON> family of modules to create a JSON
representation of the OID. So, for example, "4162F712-1DD2-11B2-B17E-C09EFE1DC403"
will be represented as C<{ "$oid" : "4162F712-1DD2-11B2-B17E-C09EFE1DC403" }>.

	my $json = JSON->new->allow_blessed->convert_blessed;
	$json->encode(MorboDB::OID->new);

=cut

sub TO_JSON { { '$oid' => shift->value } }

sub _build_value { Data::UUID->new->create_str }

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This module does not throw any errors of its own.
