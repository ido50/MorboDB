=head1 NAME

MorboDB::Collection - A MorboDB collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $coll = $db->get_collection('users');
	
	my $id = $coll->insert({
		username => 'someguy98',
		password => 's3cr3t',
		email => 'email at address dot com',
	});

	my $cursor = $coll->find({ email => qr/\@address\.com$/ })->sort({ username => 1 });
	# use cursor according to MorboDB::Cursor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the API for handling collections in a L<MorboDB::Database>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

The name of the collection. String, required.

=head2 full_name

The full name of the collection, including the name of the database, joined
by dots. String, created automatically.

=cut

has 'name' => (is => 'ro', required => 1);

has 'full_name' => (is => 'ro', lazy_build => 1);

has '_database' => (is => 'ro', required => 1, weak_ref => 1);

has '_data' => (is => 'ro', default => sub { {} }, clearer => '_clear_data');

=head1 STATIC FUNCTIONS

=head2 to_index_string( $keys )

Receives a hash-reference, array-reference or L<Tie::IxHash> object and
converts into a query string.

=cut

sub to_index_string {
	# this function is just stolen as-is from MongoDB::Collection
	my $keys = shift;

	my @name;
	if (ref $keys eq 'ARRAY' || ref $keys eq 'HASH') {
		while ((my $idx, my $d) = each(%$keys)) {
			push(@name, $idx);
			push(@name, $d);
		}
	} elsif (ref $keys eq 'Tie::IxHash') {
		my @ks = $keys->Keys;
		my @vs = $keys->Values;
		@vs = $keys->Values;

		for (my $i=0; $i<$keys->Length; $i++) {
			push(@name, $ks[$i]);
			push(@name, $vs[$i]);
		}
	} else {
		confess 'expected Tie::IxHash, hash, or array reference for keys';
	}

	return join('_', @name);
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 get_collection( $name )

Returns a MorboDB::Collection for the collection called C<$name> within this collection.

=cut

sub get_collection {
	my ($self, $name) = @_;

	return $self->_database->get_collection($self->name.'.'.$name);
}

=head2 find( [ $query ] )

Executes the given query and returns a L<MorboDB::Cursor> object with the
results (if query is not provided, all documents in the collection will
match). C<$query> can be a hash reference, a L<Tie::IxHash> object, or
array reference (with an even number of elements).

The set of fields returned can be limited through the use of the
C<< MorboDB::Cursor->fields() >> method on the resulting cursor object.
Other commonly used cursor methods are C<limit()>, C<skip()>, and C<sort()>.

As opposed to C<< MongoDB::Collection->find() >>, this method doesn't take a hash-ref
of options such as C<fields> and C<sort>, use the appropriate methods on
the cursor instead (this is also deprecated in MongoDB anyway).

Note that currently, providing a C<Tie::IxHash> object or array reference
will have no special effect, as the query will be converted into a hash
reference. This may or may not change in future version.

For a complete reference on querying in MorboDB, please look at L<MQUL::Reference/"QUERY STRUCTURES">.

=cut

sub find {
	my ($self, $query) = @_;

	confess "query must be a hash reference, even-numbered array reference or Tie::IxHash object."
		if $query &&	ref $query ne 'HASH' &&
				ref $query ne 'Tie::IxHash' &&
				(ref $query ne 'ARRAY' ||
					(ref $query eq 'ARRAY' && scalar @$query % 2 != 0)
				);

	# turn array queries into Tie::IxHash objects
	if ($query && ref $query eq 'ARRAY') {
		$query = Tie::IxHash->new(@$query);
	}

	# turn Tie::IxHash objects into hash-refs
	if ($query && ref $query eq 'Tie::IxHash') {
		my %new_query = map { $_ => $query->FETCH($_) } $query->Keys;
		$query = \%new_query;
	}

	$query ||= {};

	return MorboDB::Cursor->new(_coll => $self, _query => $query);
}

=head2 query( [ $query ] )

Alias for C<find()>.

=cut

sub query { shift->find(@_) }

=head2 find_one( [ $query ] )

Executes the provided query and returns the first result found (if any,
otherwise C<undef> is returned).

Internally, this is really a shortcut for running C<< $coll->find($query)->limit(1)->next() >>.

=cut

sub find_one { shift->find(@_)->limit(1)->next }

=head2 insert( $doc )

Inserts the given document into the database and returns it's ID.
The document can be a hash reference, an even-numbered array reference
or a Tie::IxHash object. The ID is the _id value specified in the data
or a L<MorboDB::OID> object created automatically.

Note that providing a Tie::IxHash object or array reference will not make
your document ordered, as documents are always saved as hash references,
so this has no benefit except compatibility with MongoDB.

=cut

sub insert { ($_[0]->batch_insert([$_[1]]))[0] }

=head2 batch_insert( \@docs )

Inserts each of the documents in the array into the database and returns
an array of their _id attributes.

=cut

sub batch_insert {
	my ($self, $docs) = @_;

	confess "batch_insert() expects an array reference of documents."
		unless $docs && ref $docs eq 'ARRAY';

	foreach my $doc (@$docs) {
		confess "data to insert must be a hash reference, even-numbered array reference or Tie::IxHash object."
			unless $doc && (ref $doc eq 'HASH' || ref $doc eq 'Tie::IxHash' || (ref $doc eq 'ARRAY' && scalar @$doc % 2 == 0));

		# turn array documents into Tie::IxHash objects
		if ($doc && ref $doc eq 'ARRAY') {
			$doc = Tie::IxHash->new(@$doc);
		}

		# turn Tie::IxHash objects into hash-refs
		if ($doc && ref $doc eq 'Tie::IxHash') {
			my %new_doc = map { $_ => $doc->FETCH($_) } $doc->Keys;
			$doc = \%new_doc;
		}

		$doc->{_id} ||= MorboDB::OID->new;

		my $oid = blessed $doc->{_id} && blessed $doc->{_id} eq 'MorboDB::OID' ?
			$doc->{_id}->value : $doc->{_id};
		confess "duplicate key error, ID $oid already exists in the collection."
			if exists $self->_data->{$oid};
	}

	return map { $self->save($_) } @$docs;
}

=head2 update( $query, \%update, [ \%opts ] )

Updates document(s) that match the provided query (which is the same as
what C<find()> accepts) according to the update (C<\%update>) hash-ref.

Return a hash-ref of information about the update, including number of documents
updated (n).

C<update()> can take a hash reference of options. The options currently supported are:

=over

=item * C<upsert> - If no object matches the query, C<\%update> will be inserted
as a new document (possibly taking values from C<$query> too).

=item * C<multiple> - All of the documents that match the query will be updated,
not just the first document found.

=back

For a complete reference on update syntax and behavior, please look at
L<MQUL::Reference/"UPDATE STRUCTURES">.

=cut

sub update {
	my ($self, $query, $update, $opts) = @_;

	confess "query must be a hash reference, even-numbered array reference or Tie::IxHash object."
		if $query &&	ref $query ne 'HASH' &&
				ref $query ne 'Tie::IxHash' &&
				(ref $query ne 'ARRAY' ||
					(ref $query eq 'ARRAY' && scalar @$query % 2 != 0)
				);

	$query ||= {};

	confess "the update structure must be a hash reference."
		unless $update && ref $update eq 'HASH';

	confess "the options structure must be a hash reference."
		if $opts && ref $opts ne 'HASH';

	$opts ||= {};

	my @docs;
	if ($opts->{multiple}) {
		@docs = $self->find($query)->all;
	} else {
		my $doc = $self->find_one($query);
		push(@docs, $doc) if $doc;
	}

	if (scalar @docs == 0 && $opts->{upsert}) {
		# take attributes from the query where appropriate
		my $doc = {};
		foreach (keys %$query) {
			next if $_ eq '_id';
			$doc->{$_} = $query->{$_}
				if !ref $query->{$_};
		}
		$doc->{_id} ||= MorboDB::OID->new;
		my $id = $self->save(update_doc($doc, $update));
		return {
			ok => 1,
			n => 1,
			upserted => $id,
			updatedExisting => false,
			wtime => 0,
		};
	} else {
		foreach (@docs) {
			$self->save(update_doc($_, $update));
		}
		return {
			ok => 1,
			n => scalar @docs,
			updatedExisting => true,
			wtime => 0,
		};
	}
}

=head2 remove( [ $query, \%opts ] )

Removes all objects matching the given query from the database. If a query
is not given, removes all objects from the collection.

Returns a hash-ref of information about the remove, including how many
documents were removed (n).

C<remove()> can take a hash reference of options. The options currently supported are:

=over

=item * C<just_one> - Only one matching document to be removed instead of all.

=back

=cut

sub remove {
	my ($self, $query, $opts) = @_;

	confess "query must be a hash reference, even-numbered array reference or Tie::IxHash object."
		if $query &&	ref $query ne 'HASH' &&
				ref $query ne 'Tie::IxHash' &&
				(ref $query ne 'ARRAY' ||
					(ref $query eq 'ARRAY' && scalar @$query % 2 != 0)
				);

	confess "the options structure must be a hash reference."
		if $opts && ref $opts ne 'HASH';

	$query ||= {};
	$opts ||= {};

	my @docs = $opts->{just_one} ? ($self->find_one($query)) : $self->find($query)->all;
	foreach (@docs) {
		my $oid = blessed $_->{_id} && blessed $_->{_id} eq 'MorboDB::OID' ?
			$_->{_id}->value : $_->{_id};
		delete $self->_data->{$oid};
	}

	return {
		ok => 1,
		n => scalar @docs,
		wtime => 0,
	};
}

=head2 ensure_index()

Not implemented. Simply returns true here.

=cut

sub ensure_index { 1 } # not implemented

=head2 save( \%doc )

Inserts a document into the database if it does not have an C<_id> field,
upserts it if it does have an C<_id> field. Mostly used internally. Document
must be a hash-reference.

=cut

sub save {
	my ($self, $doc) = @_;

	confess "document to save must be a hash reference."
		unless $doc && ref $doc eq 'HASH';

	$doc->{_id} ||= MorboDB::OID->new;

	my $oid = blessed $doc->{_id} && blessed $doc->{_id} eq 'MorboDB::OID' ?
		$doc->{_id}->value : $doc->{_id};

	$self->_data->{$oid} = clone($doc);

	return $doc->{_id};
}

=head2 count( [ $query ] )

Shortcut for running C<< $coll->find($query)->count() >>.

=cut

sub count {
	my ($self, $query) = @_;

	$self->find($query)->count;
}

=head2 validate()

Not implemented. Returns an empty hash-ref here.

=cut

sub validate { {} } # not implemented

=head2 drop_indexes()

Not implemented. Returns true here.

=cut

sub drop_indexes { 1 } # not implemented

=head2 drop_index()

Not implemented. Returns true here.

=cut

sub drop_index { 1 } # not implemented

=head2 get_indexes()

Not implemented. Returns false here.

=cut

sub get_indexes { return } # not implemented

=head2 drop()

Deletes the collection and all documents in it.

=cut

sub drop {
	my $self = shift;

	$self->_clear_data;
	delete $self->_database->_colls->{$self->name};
	return;
}

sub _build_full_name { $_[0]->_database->name.'.'.$_[0]->name }

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This module throws the following exceptions:

=over

=item C<< expected Tie::IxHash, hash, or array reference for keys >>

This error is returned by the static C<to_index_string()> function if you're
not providing it with a hash reference, array reference (even-numbered)
or Tie::IxHash object.

=item C<< query must be a hash reference, even-numbered array reference or Tie::IxHash object. >>

This error is returned by the C<find()>, C<query()>, C<update()>, C<remove()>
and C<count()> methods, that expect a query that is either a hash reference, even-numbered
array reference or Tie::IxHash object. Just make sure you're providing
a valid query variable.

=item C<< batch_insert() expects an array reference of documents. >>

This error is thrown by C<batch_insert()> if you're not giving it an
array reference of documents to insert into the database.

=item C<< data to insert must be a hash reference, even-numbered array reference or Tie::IxHash object. >>

This error is thrown by C<insert()> and C<batch_insert()> when you're providing
them with a document which is not a hash reference, even-numbered array
reference or Tie::IxHash object. Just make sure your document(s) is/are
valid.

=item C<< duplicate key error, ID %s already exists in the collection. >>

This error is thrown by C<insert()> and C<batch_insert()>, when you're trying
to insert a document with an C<_id> attribute that already exists in the
collection. If you're trying to update a document you know already exists,
use the C<update()> method instead. Otherwise you're just doing it wrong.

=item C<< the update structure must be a hash reference. >>

This error is thrown by the C<update()> method when you're not giving it
a proper update hash-ref, as described by L<MQUL::Reference/"UPDATE STRUCTURES">.

=item C<< the options structure must be a hash reference. >>

This error is thrown by C<update()> when you're providing it with a third
argument that should be an options hash-ref, or by the C<remove()> method
when you're providing it with a second argument that should be an options
hash-ref. Just make sure you're not sending non hash-refs to these methods.

=item C<< document to save must be a hash reference. >>

This error is thrown by the C<save()> method when it receives a document
which is not a hash reference. If this happens when invoking C<insert()>
or C<batch_insert()>, and non of the specific errors of these methods were
thrown, please submit a bug report. Otherwise (if you've called C<save()>
directly, please make sure you're providing a hash reference. As opposed
to C<insert()> and C<batch_insert()>, C<save()> does not take a Tie::IxHash
objects or even-numbered array references.
